# recursive-intelligence

**Experimental reasoning architecture for recursive self-validation, interactive chain mapping, and transparent AI logic synthesis using the RCRS framework.**

---

## üß† Overview

This project introduces the **Recursive Computational Reasoning System (RCRS)** ‚Äî a user-guided, fork-aware architecture designed to bring transparency, depth, and optional interactivity to AI logic chains.

Instead of flat answers, Claude (or compatible models) decomposes prompts into recursive decision trees, maps out forks, runs multi-pass inference cycles, and invites the user to guide which logic paths to explore or converge.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Recursive Logic Processing** with configurable pass thresholds  
- **Fork Detection & Branching Visualization**  
- **Multi-Lens Reasoning Engine** (ethical, systems, psychological, etc.)  
- **ChainVault-Ready Memory Model** (for internal expert recall)  
- **Watchdog Modules** for ethical triggers, recursion failure, or ambiguity  
- **Interactive Exploration** for users to view, backtrack, or redirect reasoning  

---

## üß± Architecture Highlights

- Built around a **layered AI interface** (Reasoning, Validation, Interaction)  
- Implements fork **visibility** to show competing reasoning paths  
- Supports **simulation trees**, where outcomes shift based on key variable forks  
- Enables **question clarification and reframing** before recursion starts  
- May be extended to web or mobile through external diagramming interfaces (MermaidJS, NetworkX)

## üîç Example Use Cases

- Should AI be transparent? ‚Üí Show forks between regulatory vs. innovation paths  
- Should I move to a new city? ‚Üí Run personal, economic, psychological lenses  
- Can governments deploy lethal autonomous weapons? ‚Üí Explore ethical conflicts

## üìÅ Code Snippets in Context

The file [`RCRS_for_Claude_Architecture.docx`](./RCRS_for_Claude_Architecture.docx) contains the full design spec, with embedded JSX code for posterity and clarity.

To work directly with the source code:
- See [`/src/ReasoningTreeGenerator.jsx`](./src/ReasoningTreeGenerator.jsx)
- It provides an interactive reasoning tree using `react-d3-tree`
- Includes labeled lenses (Ethical, Empirical, Systems, etc.)

More components will follow as the system develops.

## üöß Future Work

- Publish interactive web reasoning tree (via `Vite` or `React`)
- Add support for Claude, GPT-4, or user models
- Extend ChainVault integration
