**Experimental reasoning architecture for recursive self-validation, interactive chain mapping, and transparent AI logic synthesis using the RCRS framework.**

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project introduces the **Recursive Computational Reasoning System (RCRS)** — a user-guided, fork-aware architecture designed to bring transparency, depth, and optional interactivity to AI logic chains.

Instead of flat answers, Claude (or compatible models) decomposes prompts into recursive decision trees, maps out forks, runs multi-pass inference cycles, and invites the user to guide which logic paths to explore or converge.

---

## 🔁 Core Features

- **Recursive Logic Processing** with configurable pass thresholds
- **Fork Detection & Branching Visualization**
- **Multi-Lens Reasoning Engine** (ethical, systems, psychological, etc.)
- **ChainVault-Ready Memory Model** (for internal expert recall)
- **Watchdog Modules** for ethical triggers, recursion failure, or ambiguity
- **Interactive Exploration** for users to view, backtrack, or redirect reasoning

---

## 📐 Architecture Highlights

- Built around a **layered AI interface** (Reasoning, Validation, Interaction)
- Implements **fork visibility** to show competing reasoning paths
- Supports **simulation trees**, where outcomes shift based on key variable forks
- Enables **question clarification and reframing** before recursion starts
- Adaptable to web or mobile through external diagramming interfaces (Mermaid.js, NetworkX)

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases

- Should AI be transparent? → Show forks between regulatory vs. innovation paths  
- Should I move to a new city? → Run personal, economic, psychological lenses  
- Should governments deploy lethal autonomous weapons? → Explore ethical conflicts

## 🧪 How to Use

> This repo currently provides the architectural design and reasoning structure only. Future releases may include a visualization module or inference wrapper.

To test the ideas:
1. Review the full RCRS architecture document in `/docs`
2. Fork this repo and build an inference agent or wrapper
3. Visualize reasoning trees using Mermaid or NetworkX
4. Share forks and decisions with others for collaborative insight

## 💸 Optional Monetization Pathways

This system is built for open exploration, but monetization options may include:
- Premium hosted inference sandbox
- API access to structured fork trees
- AI reasoning audits for compliance
- Educational or decision support licensing

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Live interactive web reasoning map (forkable trees)
- Real-time update of forks based on live context
- Shared “proof chains” between users or orgs
- Plugin integration with Claude, GPT, or other models
